Two analog channels and one event array

analog signal 0: Voltage trace; 1 unit = 20mV
analog signal 1: vibration stimulus; 1 unit = 27.2um
event array: event 0 - start of proper recording in s
             event 1 - start of proper recording in s


Assumptions:

Minimum amplitude of vibration signal

The current signal seems to be leading the actual current injection by 10 samples at 20833.333 Hz.

Generalization: -[fy,]fx,a,b,v

"f" is flag to denote that a function is selected from the function list that you can see in that function panel.

"fx" is the function number.

"a" Refers to average. If it is selected the value is 1 else 0

"b"  Refers to bins. If results are calculated on "No of Bins" its 0, else if on "Width of bin" its 1.

"v" Refers to value of "b".


Examples:
- f 0, 0, 0, 10.0
Computes Soma surface with No. of bins as 10.
- f 1, 1, 0, 10.0
Computes N_stems, averaged with No of bins as 10.
- f 4, 0, 1, 5
Computes N_tips with width of bins as 10.


Line 2:

-R Raw Data

Types of Outputs:

The output is printed swcfile wise, i.e., all results for all measures are printed for input file1, then for input file2, etc.

1. if fy is not specified, just returns the statistics of the measure specified by 'fx'.
   output: "<Input File>\t<Metric>\t<Total_Sum><#Compartments (considered)>\t<#Compartments(discarded)>\t<Minimum>\t<Average>\t<Maximum>\t<S.D.>"

2. if fx==fy : histogram of measure 'fx' with bins as specified by 'b','v'.
   if a==0: output: "<Input File>\t<measure> Distribution:<measure>\t<tab separated histogram bin centers>\n\t<measure>\t<tab separated histogram bin counts>"

3. if fx!=fy : Scatter plot of measure 'fy' vs measure 'fx'. NOTE: Average option(a) on line 1 of input file must be 1.
   if a==1: output: "<Input File>\t<measure1>VS<measure2>:<measure1>\t<tab separated bin centers of measure1>\n\t<measure2>\t<tab separated bin averages of measure2>\n StdDev\t<tab separated bin standard deviations of measure2>"

4. if '-R' option is given, the raw data is first printed in the file, one per line and then the standard "<Input File>...." is printed.

Notes:

1. f17 is XYZ with raw data always outputted. 'Helix' is f43 and 'Fractal_Dim' is f44
